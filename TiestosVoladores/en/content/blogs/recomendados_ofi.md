Hi! Want to know what I actually use in my day to day life to stay productive and comfortable working and researching? Today I'm sharing with you my 7 favorite Amazon products that have become must-haves in my daily routine!

1. Akko 3098B Mechanical Keyboard

This keyboard has become my inseparable companion. I use it every day for its comfort, quality and multiple wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, 2.4G and cable). Its RGB backlighting and mechanical keys make it perfect for long work sessions.

2. Logitech M720 Mouse

Controlling up to three devices with a single mouse is possible. Since using this wireless mouse, I can easily switch between my laptop, tablet and office computer with one click.

If you prefer a wired mouse this is my recommended one. (See on Amazon)[https://amzn.to/43yduu9]  

3. Adjustable Laptop Stand

This adjustable stand I take it everywhere with me. It is very light.

4. Water Thermos

Keeping me hydrated is very important. This thermos keeps drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours. It comes in many colors and sizes and has three interchangeable lids. I take it with me everywhere I go.

5. Soundcore Life Q30 Active Noise Canceling Headphones by Anker
   
Nothing improves my concentration more than isolating myself from external noise. These active noise-cancelling headphones filter out up to 95% of ambient sound, deliver high-resolution sound and are super comfortable to wear for hours. Plus, the battery lasts many days, ideal for long work days or travel.
